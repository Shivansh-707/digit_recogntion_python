This project showcases a simple yet powerful digit recognition system built using a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset. 
The model was designed with a minimal architecture — a flattened input layer followed by a dense hidden layer with ReLU activation,
and an output layer with softmax for classifying digits (0–9). The trained model is saved as digit_model.h5.

To make the project interactive and user-friendly, a PyQt5-based GUI was developed.
Users can draw digits on a canvas, and upon clicking a button, the model predicts the digit in real-time. 
This project combines deep learning with desktop application development, making it a fun and educational tool for exploring neural networks in action.
